Occassionally, I teach courses on: Cybersecurity, Secure SDLC, and Performance Engineering. This page will provide details of the courses while I am teaching them. Currently (as of June 2025) I am not actively teaching any course - for future courses, watch this space. 

In the past, I have taught courses on: Network Security, Cloud Security, Secure SDLC, Performance Testing, Software Development, and Physics.
