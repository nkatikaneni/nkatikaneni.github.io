I am an experienced cybersecurity architect and solutions engineering leader with 20+ years of progressive experience across cloud security, network defense, threat modeling, identity management, and secure application design. I will be writing about cybersecurity, performance engineering, investing, parenting, sports and a whole lot of other random thoughts.
